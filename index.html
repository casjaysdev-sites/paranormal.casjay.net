Here you will find out more about me why I started this site.
The reason I started this site is a very simple one, I wanted to express my opinions on the paranormal.
I believe the universe is to big for us to be alone, if we are alone I thinks its a waste of space.What are the chances
of us
being alone in this vast amount of space? Give me your feed.

At this site you will see why I believe that we are not alone in the universe.
I will also talk about unknown creatures, witchcraft, The Bermuda triangle and Interesting facts
